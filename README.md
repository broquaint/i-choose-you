# i-choose-you

A small program designed to solve the paradox of choice when it comes
to choosing which game to play.

Currently contains hardcoded paths so unusable outside of the computer
it was developed on.

## Usage

Either `lein run` or `lein uberjar` and apply the resulting `.jar` as
appropriate.
